# Sokoban clone in Haskell
Sokoban (倉庫番) is a puzzle video game created by Hiroyuki Imabayashi which I'm recreating as a university assignment.

You can play the graphical version of my Sokoban clone by going to https://code.world/haskell and pasting the code from the file sokoban-code-world.hs.

Command line version coming soon!
